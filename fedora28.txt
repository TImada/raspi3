- Fedora 27 aarch64 for Raspberry Pi 3
1. Create an OS-ready SD card
-> Follow the instruction at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Raspberry_Pi
-> Use a compressed image for aarch64

2. Modify the SD card
-> Generate a password for root, and modifiy /etc/shadow in the SD card
-> Create a configuration file for eth0 in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
   (You can modify ifcfg-enp1s0 in the same directory for this aim)
-> Modify the initial script in /usr/libexec/initial-setup/run-initial-setup so that additional configurations can be canceled
$ cat /usr/libexec/initial-setup/run-initial-setup
#!/bin/bash
IS_UNIT=initial-setup.service
echo "Initial Setup finished successfully, disabling" | systemd-cat -t initial-setup -p 6
systemctl -q is-enabled $IS_UNIT && systemctl disable $IS_UNIT
echo "Initial Setup has been disabled" | systemd-cat -t initial-setup -p 6

3. Boot from the SD card
-> Add another user and install additional packages

4. Install clasp, clingo and aspcud
-> yum install gcc gcc-c++ make cmake bison re2c boost boost-devel clang
-> git clone https://github.com/potassco/clasp
   cd clasp
   cmake -H. -B.
   cmake --build .
   cmake --build . --target install
-> git clone https://github.com/potassco/clingo
   cd clingo
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cmake -H . -B . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build .
   cmake --build . --target install
-> git clone https://github.com/potassco/aspcud
   cd aspcud
   mkdir -p build/release
   cd build/release
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
   make
   make install

5. Install opam
(the opam command you can get by the yum command seemed buggy, so I decided to use an older version)
-> yum install ocaml ocaml-ocamldoc ocaml-findlib ocaml-ocamlbuild jbuilder bubblewrap
-> get v1.2.2 from https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/download/1.2.2/opam-full-1.2.2.tar.gz
-> Follow README.md to compile and install opam
-> Execute "opam init" and other commands for you

6. Update the Solo5 repository for aarch64
-> Execute "opam repo add solo5-dev git://github.com/Solo5/opam-solo5"

7. Install Solo5(ukvm)-related packages
-> as you want :-)
-> output example

(Optional) Configuration for the USB rootfs
-> Attach the SD card including Fedora OS (created in the above) and an empty USB-based disk to a Linux machine.
   (Assume the SD card is /dev/sda, and the USB-based Disk is /dev/sdb)
-> Create two partitions (for OS area and swap) on the USB-based disk.
   fdisk /dev/sdb # create the two parititions depending on the size you want to have.
   /dev/sdb1: OS area
   /dev/sdb2: swap
-> copy the original OS area in the SD card to the created partition for OS
   dd if=/dev/sda5 of=/dev/sdb1 bs=32M
   e2fsck -f /dev/sdb1
   resize2fs /dev/sdb1
-> Format the swap partition
   mkswap /dev/sdb2
-> Modify /etc/fstab and /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg on the SD card and copy /etc/fstab on the SD card to the USB-based disk
   mount /dev/sda5 /media # mount the OS partition on the SD card
   vim /media/etc/fstab # modify it so that the rootfs and swap partitions can be used
   vim /media/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg # modify it so that the rootfs can be used
   mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt # mount the OS partition on the USB-based disk
   cp /media/etc/fstab /mnt/etc/ # copy the fstab file
   umount /mnt
   umount /media
